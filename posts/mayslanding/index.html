<p>While there is some debate about the definition of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/abandoned/comments/rmg2ws/abandoned_gas_station_in_mays_landing_nj/">abandoned</a> gas stations as to how old does a gas station have to be operational to be declared as abandoned, we can generally agree with the notion that  an abandoned gas station is presents a significant risk to the community.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-do">What we do?</h3>
<p>We use bio-remediation products <a href="https://shop.sarvabioremd.com">AgroRemed</a> and <a href="https://shop.sarvabioremed.com">HydroRemed</a> as part of our cleanup protocol.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The tanks were removed in 2018, we closed this project on Jan 17th 2022.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes">Some Notes</h3>
<p><a href="https://development.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/development/community/redevelopment/abandoned-gas-station-cleanup-grant">Ohio DEP</a> has been running these grant programs for quite sometime, allocating approximately USD 600,000.00 for cleanup. The project that we just closed had 8 tanks with a total outlay of USD 180,000.00. We attribute these low costs in our project to using AgroRemed/HydroRemed as soon as baseline numbers are established. In the above project, we had to wait for almost a year before we could get the permit-by-rule (PBR) exception to add AgroRemed and HydroRemed to the site. Our preference would have been that the DEP recognize that since AgroRemed/HydroRemed are listed as a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/spillremed-mariner">bioremediation agent</a> since 2001, the exception application could have been waived. This would have shortened the project by at least ninety days. In traditional, competitive approaches, delays in days don&rsquo;t really count as these projects tend to extend for a few years; however, when adding AgroRemed/HydroRemed to the cleanup protocol, the time-lines have usually shortened to 3 - 4 months for remediation below the detection limits. These numbers are based on our experience in past projects.</p>

<p>These numbers went down from above RCL to ND within 4 weeks, an observation that is consistent with our results in past projects. The project went into a monitoring stage as some secondary contamination was detected and the project finally was closed this week.</p>
