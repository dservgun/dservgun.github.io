      <description>Enhanced Aerobic Bio-remediation Report Introduction In this report, we present data collected on aerobicbio-remediation of soil contaminated with Perchloroethene (PCE), Trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-Dichloroethene (cis12DCE) and Vinyl Chloride (VC) using VaporRemed.
Enhanced Aerobic Bio-remediation of Chlorintaed Hydrocarbons The reference, In Situ Bioremediaton : When Does It Work?, lists at least three criteria for demonstrating that in situ bio-remediation is effective for a given project:
 Documented loss of contaminants from the site due to bio-remediation, Labotary assays showing that the micro-organisms in site samples have the potential to transform contaminants under expected site condition, and One or more pieces of evidence showing that the bio-remediation potential is actually realized in the field.</description>
